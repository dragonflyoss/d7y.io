Dragonfly provides efficient, stable, and secure file distribution and image acceleration using P2P technology
within cloud-native architectures. This talk will briefly introduce Dragonfly and highlight the features
of its latest version. Key updates include enhanced security and new functionalities tailored for more efficient
and robust model distribution. We will also demonstrate how Dragonfly preheats and distributes
AI models (packaged as OCI Artifacts) to read-only volumes in Kubernetes, enabling faster deployments.
