This document will help you experience how to use Dragonfly's three preheat methods,
namely Open API preheat, console preheat and harbor preheat.

## Open API

Use Open API to preheat.

### Configuration

If the client is `containerd`, it is recommended to configure `proxy.defaultFilter` in dfget.yaml and set it to `Expires&Signature&ns`,
because containerd will add `ns` query params to the blobs download URL,
refer to [containerd/remotes/docker/resolver.go](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/remotes/docker/resolver.go#L493).
Which will cause the generated Task ID to be different from the preheat Task ID, so it is impossible to hit the preheat blobs.

```yaml
# proxy service detail option
proxy:
  defaultFilter: 'Expires&Signature&ns'
```

### Create personal access token

Click the `ADD PERSONAL ACCESS TOKENS` button to create personal access token.

**Name**: Set your token a descriptive name.

**Description**: Set a description.

**Expiration**: Set your token an expiration.

**Scopes**: Select the access permissions for the token.

![create-token](../resource/advanced-guides/personal-access-tokens/create-token.png)

Click `SAVE` and copy the token and store it. For your security, it doesn't display again.

![copy-token](../resource/advanced-guides/personal-access-tokens/copy-token.png)

### Preheat image

Use Open API for preheating image. First create a POST request for preheating.

If the `scheduler_cluster_ids` does not exist,
it means to preheat all scheduler clusters.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://dragonfly-manager:8080/oapi/v1/jobs' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_dragonfly_personal_access_token' \
--data-raw '{
    "type": "preheat",
    "args": {
        "type": "image",
        "url": "https://index.docker.io/v2/library/alpine/manifests/3.19",
        "filteredQueryParams": "Expires&Signature",
        "username": "your_registry_username",
        "password": "your_registry_password"
    }
}'
```

The command-line log returns the preheat job id.

```bash
{
  "id": 1,
  "created_at": "2024-04-18T08:51:55Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-04-18T08:51:55Z",
  "task_id": "group_2717f455-ff0a-435f-a3a7-672828d15a2a",
  "type": "preheat",
  "state": "PENDING",
  "args": {
    "filteredQueryParams": "Expires&Signature",
    "headers": null,
    "password": "",
    "pieceLength": 4194304,
    "platform": "",
    "tag": "",
    "type": "file",
    "url": "https://index.docker.io/v2/library/alpine/manifests/3.19",
    "username": ""
  },
  "scheduler_clusters": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "created_at": "2024-04-18T08:29:15Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-04-18T08:29:15Z",
      "name": "cluster-1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Polling the preheating status with job id.

```bash
curl --request GET 'http://dragonfly-manager:8080/oapi/v1/jobs/1' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_dragonfly_personal_access_token'
```

If the status is `SUCCESS`, the preheating is successful.

```bash
{
  "id": 1,
  "created_at": "2024-04-18T08:51:55Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-04-18T08:51:55Z",
  "task_id": "group_2717f455-ff0a-435f-a3a7-672828d15a2a",
  "type": "preheat",
  "state": "SUCCESS",
  "args": {
    "filteredQueryParams": "Expires&Signature",
    "headers": null,
    "password": "",
    "pieceLength": 4194304,
    "platform": "",
    "tag": "",
    "type": "file",
    "url": "https://index.docker.io/v2/library/alpine/manifests/3.19",
    "username": ""
  },
  "scheduler_clusters": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "created_at": "2024-04-18T08:29:15Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-04-18T08:29:15Z",
      "name": "cluster-1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Preheat file

Use Open API for preheating file. First create a POST request for preheating.

If the `scheduler_cluster_ids` does not exist,
it means to preheat all scheduler clusters.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://dragonfly-manager:8080/oapi/v1/jobs' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_dragonfly_personal_access_token' \
--header 'Authorization: token your_example.com_personal_access_token' \
--data-raw '{
    "type": "preheat",
    "args": {
        "type": "file",
        "url": "https://example.com"
    }
}'
```

The command-line log returns the preheat job id.

```bash
{
  "id": 1,
  "created_at": "2024-04-18T08:51:55Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-04-18T08:51:55Z",
  "task_id": "group_2717f455-ff0a-435f-a3a7-672828d15a2a",
  "type": "preheat",
  "state": "PENDING",
  "args": {
    "filteredQueryParams": "Expires&Signature",
    "headers": null,
    "password": "",
    "pieceLength": 4194304,
    "platform": "",
    "tag": "",
    "type": "file",
    "url": "https://index.docker.io/v2/library/alpine/manifests/3.19",
    "username": ""
  },
  "scheduler_clusters": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "created_at": "2024-04-18T08:29:15Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-04-18T08:29:15Z",
      "name": "cluster-1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Polling the preheating status with job id.

```bash
curl --request GET 'http://dragonfly-manager:8080/oapi/v1/jobs/1' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your_dragonfly_personal_access_token'
```

If the status is `SUCCESS`, the preheating is successful.

```bash
{
  "id": 1,
  "created_at": "2024-04-18T08:51:55Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-04-18T08:51:55Z",
