Manager:

- Configure scheduling weights.
- Support scopes for Personal Access Tokens (PATs).
- Regularly clean up inactive schedulers and seed peers.
- Display more Peer information in the console, such as CPU and memory usage.
- Display persistent cache information of peers in the console.
- Add management of sync peers in the console.

Scheduler:

- Optimize the scheduling algorithm to improve bandwidth utilization in the P2P network.

Client:

- Support RDMA/QUIC for faster network transmission in the P2P network, enhancing the loading of
  AI inference models into memory.
- Define a codable protocol for data transmission, providing faster encoding/decoding.
- Support persistent cache, allowing access within the P2P cluster without uploading to other storage,
  facilitating faster read/write of AI models and datasets.
- Allow peers to get the QoS of parents and select the optimal parents for downloading.
- Preheat files in the memory cache to improve download speed.

Others:

- Add more performance tests in the dfbench command.
- Add more E2E tests and unit tests.

Documentation:

- Restructure the documentation to make it easier for users to navigate.
- Enhance the landing page UI.

AI Infrastructure:

- Optimize large file distribution within the infrastructure.
- Optimize handling of a large number of small I/Os for Nydus.
